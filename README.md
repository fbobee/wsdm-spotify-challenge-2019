Spotify Sequential Skip Prediction Challenge

In this repository, we present the solution of the team Definitive Tur-
tles for ACM WSDM Cup 2019 [Spotify Sequential Skip Prediction
Challenge](https://www.crowdai.org/challenges/spotify-sequential-skip-prediction-challenge) that reached 10th place on the public leaderboard.

# Requirements

- Python 3.5 conda environment
- Python packages: turicreate, pandas, numpy, pytorch **etc.? TODO**
- In our solution we heavily depend on the parallel processing power of the turicreate package.

# Introduction

Our solution is based on gradient boosted trees (GBT) combining several
statistical features as well as the output of a recurrent neural net-
work classifier. By using GBT, we were able to assess the importance
of the various features and classifiers for skip prediction.

# Usage

Currently, we are revisioning our code in order to make it available for the public community.

Instructions on how to run our code are **comming SOON**.
