# Predictive models

This folder contains our predictive models. The folder "autoencoder_1" is the regular autoencoder, "autoencoder_2" is the sequential autoencoder, "pattern" is the (binary and ternary) pattern model, and "rnn" is the bidirectional LSTM classifier.

In general, the "train_" scripts have to be run first, and after that the "feature_gen" scripts.
